Site-specific classical calculations
==========================================

We plan to introduce special optimizations for site-specific classical
calculations. Preliminary investigations show that the GMPEs could be
made 30x faster by parallelizing on the ruptures. However the work is
currently stopped for lack of funding. Please get in contact with us if
you are willing to sponsor work in this direction.
