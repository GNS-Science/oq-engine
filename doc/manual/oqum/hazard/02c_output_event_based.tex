The Event Based PSHA calculator computes and stores stochastic event sets and
the corresponding ground motion fields. This calculator can also produce
hazard curves and hazard maps, similar to the 
Classical PSHA calculator. The inset below shows an example of the list of
results provided by the \gls{acr:oqe} at the end of an event-based PSHA
calculation:

Exporting the outputs from the ruptures will produce a CSV file with the
following colums:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{rup\_id}: incremental number identifying the rupture
\item \texttt{multiplicity}: how many times the rupture
occurs in the effective investigation time
\item \texttt{mag}: float specifying the magnitude of the rupture
\item \texttt{centroid\_lon}: longitude of the centroid of the rupture
\item \texttt{centroid\_lat}: latitude of the centroid of the rupture
\item \texttt{centroid\_depth}: depth (in km) of the centroid of the rupture
\item \texttt{trt}: string specifying the tectonic region type
\item \texttt{strike}: strike angle of the rupture surface
\item \texttt{dip}: dip angle of the rupture surface
\item \texttt{rake}: rake angle of the rupture surface
\end{enumerate}

The outputs from the \glspl{acr:gmf} can be exported in the csv
format. Exporting the outputs from the \glspl{acr:gmf} in the 
csv format results in two csv files illustrated in the example files in
Table~\ref{output:gmf_event_based} and Table~\ref{output:sitemesh}. The sites csv
file provides the association between the site ids in the \glspl{acr:gmf} csv
file with their latitude and longitude coordinates.

The \texttt{Events} output produces a csv file with fields \texttt{event\_id},
\texttt{rup\_id} and \texttt{rlz\_id}. The \texttt{event\_id} is a 32 bit
integer that identifies uniquely the event; the \texttt{rup\_id}
is a 32 bit integer that identifies uniquely the rupture; the \texttt{rlz\_id}
is a 16 bit integer that identifies uniquely the
realization. The association between the \texttt{event\_id} and
the  \texttt{rup\_id} is stored inside the \texttt{Events} output.

The \texttt{Realizations} output produces a csv file listing the source model
and the combination of ground shaking intensity models for each path sampled
from the logic tree. An example of such a file is shown below in
Table~\ref{output:realizations}.
