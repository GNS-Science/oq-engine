# Installing the OpenQuake Engine on macOS

The OpenQuake Engine can be installed on macOS with the universal installer,
provided your system has a recent enough Python (3.6.x / 3.7.x / 3.8.x).

If needed, you can install a recent version of Python (3.6.x / 3.7.x / 3.8.x)
by using the official installers provided by the Python Foundation (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Python 3.9 is **not supported**.

Make sure to run the script located under `/Applications/Python 3.X/Install Certificates.command`, after Python has been installed, to update the SSL certificates bundle [see FAQ](../faq.md#certificate-verification-on-macOS).

Python from _Anaconda_ is **not supported**.

## Requirements

Requirements are:

- macOS 10.14 (Mojave), or macOS 10.15 (Catalina)
- 4 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)
- 1.2 GB of free disk space
- [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome) or [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) app

macOS 11 (*Big Sur*) is not officially supported but some people have managed to install the engine on it using the system Python (version 3.8). New Macs with the M1 CPU are **unsupported**.

## Install packages from the OpenQuake website

Download the installer script:

```zsh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gem/oq-engine/master/install.py -O
```

From the Terminal app (or using iTerm) run:

```zsh
python3 install.py user
```

The code is installed in ~/openquake while the calculation data will be stored in ~/oqdata.

### Uninstall the OpenQuake engine

You can just remove the ~/openquake directory:

```zsh
rm -Rf ~/openquake
```

To also remove calculation data:

```zsh
rm -Rf ~/oqdata
```

## Run the OpenQuake Engine

To load the OpenQuake Engine environment you must run:

```zsh
# default is ~/openquake
source ~/openquake/bin/activate
```

before the OpenQuake Engine can be properly used.

To run the OpenQuake Engine via the command line, use:

```zsh
oq engine --run </path/to/job.ini>
```

To start the OpenQuake [WebUI](../running/server.md) use:

```zsh
oq webui start
```
The WebUI will be started and a new browser window will be opened.

More information is available at the pages [How to run the OpenQuake Engine](../running/unix.md) and [The OpenQuake Engine server and WebUI](../running/server.md).
